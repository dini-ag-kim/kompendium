# Preamble

Metadata can trace its roots back to the ancient world and the Library of Alexandria [@kennedymmawona2008]. It is of little surprise, therefore, that many facets of metadata have already been examined in different disciplines in the past. This information generally exists only in scattered and fragmented form, which hinders its classification in the subject area of educational metadata. Yet, at the same time, metadata has become an indispensable part of modern educational infrastructures. It is particularly difficult for people who are new to this topic to find and connect the relevant information. But even those with years of experience in this subject matter frequently wish to look up or update specific topics. This compendium aims to address this very issue. It represents a synthesis of sources, which is based on the concepts of open content and open education. Open educational resources (OERs) are therefore reused with corresponding identification and also made available for reuse.
