# 1 Goals and structure of the compendium

## 1.1 Who is the compendium aimed at?

Whenever data is to be exchanged outside the boundaries of a specific platform, we must define the basic conditions under which this exchange can be successfully completed. Metadata plays an important role in the exchange of data. When it comes to offering useful education services, educational metadata is of particular relevance in this field. Despite this generally recognised relevance, however, few to no overviews exist on this topic. This compendium aims to close this gap by providing an insight into the subject matter and presenting further relevant information, thereby serving as a valuable reference and starting point for future developments. It is therefore aimed at decision-makers, subject matter experts, developers and all interested persons who wish to gain a thematic overview of metadata and e-learning standards as well as of educational metadata and metadata with a didactic function.

## 1.2 How did the compendium come about?

The relevant topics and focal points for this compendium were devised in conjunction with the “German Academic Exchange Service” ([DAAD](https://www.daad.de/de/)) in the context of the organisation’s research and development project “[BIRD | Digital Education Space](https://www.daad.de/de/der-daad/was-wir-tun/digitalisierung/bird/)”. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of its [Digital Education Initiative](https://www.bildung-forschung.digital/digitalezukunft/de/bildung/initiative-digitale-bildung/initiative-digitale-bildung_node.html) (funding code 16NB008). In selecting the relevant topics and focal points, every effort was made to ensure that the content is also relevant for other networking initiatives in the educational sector and offers interested people added value as well as an introduction to the topic. A range of publications were included in this process, particularly from the projects JOINTLY.info, Open Edu Hub / WirLernenOnline, ComeIn, as well as DINI-AG-KIM groups (incl. the OER metadata group) and the networking initiative of the German Foundation for Innovation in Higher Education.

## 1.3 How is the compendium structured?

What exactly is metadata and what are metadata standards? This question is answered at the start of the compendium. It then goes on to describe basic technical principles concerning the provision of metadata, data exchange and the generation of metadata. Thereafter, we turn to the matter of didactic metadata itself. Following an introduction and explanation of the challenges posed by this topic, the compendium provides an overview of the metadata fields and their specific usage. Applications of didactic metadata are described to demonstrate which scenarios can be addressed with didactic attributes and value lists and in which areas there is a still need for further research.

## 1.4 Initial situation and goals

**Individual educational journeys and lifelong learning**

Learning processes accompany us throughout our lives and extend far beyond the temporal and spatial borders of the regular education system. Digital learning processes are playing an increasingly important role in this regard. Against the background of “lifelong learning” ([Europäische Kommission 2002, 17](#ref-europaeischekommissionerll2002)), it is easy to see why learners encounter a number of challenges when switching between the various stations of their learning journey. This gives rise to an important question: How can existing digital education platforms be efficiently interconnected to make individual learning journeys a seamless experience for learners and to shape ongoing transformation processes in the education system in a sustainable manner? In this context, the focus of the transformation processes is on the learner’s journey, the shaping and design of learning experiences as well as individual learning paths or learning journeys.

**Hand in hand: connecting distributed education infrastructures**

The establishment of distributed education platforms as cloud-based services along with the provision of useful microservices remains an ongoing trend in the digitalisation of the education landscape. This requires an increased focus on both the interoperability and scalability of distributed systems in order to ensure high and sustainable availability of the relevant infrastructure so that transformation processes in the education system can be supported effectively. The provision and exchange of metadata between these systems is essential in this case. Metadata is omnipresent throughout this process and plays a crucial role in supporting interactions and procedures in the digital sphere.

As a result, this compendium places particular emphasis on metadata of digital objects in the context of teaching/learning environments and teaching/learning processes. The aim is to conduct a closer examination of the didactic aspects of these objects in metadata that arise during the individual educational journeys of learners in connection with a digital education hub. Educational resources are objects which, when used appropriately in educational contexts and associated teaching/learning processes, allow specific learning objectives to be achieved or the relevant skills and competencies to be developed ([Anido et al. 2002, 359](#ref-anidoemblr2002)), ([Sutton 2004, 142–47](#ref-suttonmes2004)).
