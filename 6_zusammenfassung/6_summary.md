# 6 Summary and outlook

Metadata plays a key role in shaping a contemporary educational landscape and is important for a variety of application scenarios to improve the quality of teaching and learning processes. A broad range of disciplines and topics come together in this context, making it challenging to gain an overview, particularly for those who are new to the subject. Yet even though there has been intensive discussion about networking and data exchange in the education sector since the turn of the millennium, a common standard has not yet been found, quickly giving rise to the impression that no progress has been made. Why is this? Has there really not been any progress in this field?

**Challenges in a digitalised education landscape**

- **Diversity of the systems and interfaces**

> In a digitalised education landscape, there is a large number of learning platforms, applications and tools that have been developed for different purposes. These systems use heterogeneous interfaces and protocols, thereby hampering interoperability. When platforms are unable to communicate seamlessly with each other, this leads to fragmentation, which hinders the smooth exchange of data between the different systems.

- **Lack of consistent use of standards**

> There is no consistent use of standards for creating and sharing digital educational resources in educational services. This leads to incompatibilities when exchanging data between the various systems. Without the use of common standards, it is difficult to harmonise data and reuse it in distributed services.

- **Heterogeneous data quality**

> In digital educational hubs, data comes from different sources and is often of a very heterogeneous quality. Lack of metadata also makes it difficult to search for and find educational resources. This presents challenges when it comes to reuse.

**How are these challenges being addressed?**

Firstly, it should be noted that in some areas, considerable progress has indeed been made. Particularly the [first major OER funding phase in 2016/17](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/shareddocs/bekanntmachungen/de/2016/01/1132_bekanntmachung.html) gave rise to a number of initiatives that resulted in significant progress in terms of interoperability, standardisation and knowledge exchange. This includes the [OER metadata group](https://wiki.dnb.de/display/DINIAGKIM/OER-Metadatengruppe), which sets national standards through the collaborative development of processes and standards and, with the technologies it uses, is also compatible with EU and international standards. Since 2022, stakeholders have also been collaborating in the Cooperation Network OER Supporting Infrastructures and Services ([KNOER](https://kn-oer.de/)).

**Requirements in a digital education hub**

Educational resources and other object types not only need to be technically compatible with different platforms and learning environments, but, in particular, also suitable – or at least adaptable – for the target group. Greater consideration needs to be given to the reusability of resources right from the creation and distribution stage, in order to achieve efficient reuse. Modularisation, for example, by creating smaller learning units[\^26], ensures greater flexibility in terms of reuse. Reusability is improved with granular, didactic components. However, the implementation of these aspects in the creation, reuse and remix of educational resources is not (simply) a technological issue. In addition, extensive community management is also required, for example, in the areas of open educational resources, open educational practices [@koschorreckoepodfp2018] and maintaining compatibility with standards. However, these aspects are often given a low priority in projects and it is often left to the initiative of individuals to organise the transfer and exchange of relevant knowledge, particularly in the field of educational metadata.

**Practical testing of metadata use cases**

Metadata is not an end in itself, but serves to fulfil a specific task. This is also true for educational metadata. However, if this task is not linked to a concrete product or a usage scenario, any discussion will remain somewhat theoretical in nature, and no feedback regarding usefulness and usability will be gained from a concrete implementation by a service or from users. This hinders progress in this field.

In addition, the role of educational metadata often remains unclear: Is the metadata to be used for a specific function within an application or does it merely serve to describe and represent an object? These two questions relate to completely different aspects, which are reflected in the characteristics of the attributes and their values. If the data is then also exchanged, this often results in a loss of information because the value lists in the data exchange standards are under-specified and describe the lowest common denominator that has been agreed upon.

**How is the field of educational metadata developing?**

Overall, discussion on the subject of educational metadata in recent years shows that the standardisation of the field is heavily dependent on specific use cases. It is crucial that the development of educational metadata is closely linked with the aims and requirements of a particular educational context. While generic standardisation seems extremely difficult due to the lack of consensus, various attributes and values can and should be standardised for specific use cases in order to facilitate data exchange.

Educational metadata is essential for use cases such as intelligent recommender systems, the adaptive creation of learning paths or diagnostics and support in digital learning environments. It is therefore essential that we continue to promote the development and implementation of didactic metadata in the educational sector to enable the effective use of digital technologies that will improve teaching and learning processes.

In summary, metadata in education is an important pillar for the efficient management and use of educational resources in order to make data-based decisions to improve teaching and learning processes. Even though educational metadata offers numerous benefits, challenges remain in terms of quality, standardisation and exchange. To overcome these challenges and further improve the use of metadata in education, future efforts should focus on several key tasks:

- Standardisation: promoting the development, acceptance and adoption of common metadata standards to ensure consistency and compatibility between different educational services.
- Automation: establishing technologies for the automated creation, validation and updating of metadata in order to rationalise the process of metadata management.
- Research: investigating the use of educational metadata in different teaching and learning contexts as well as the usefulness and effectiveness of learning support or recommender systems to support personalised learning experiences based on educational metadata.

**Participation in and subsequent use of the compendium**

This compendium is intended to be a starting point for further work and future development of the subject of educational metadata. To allow the document to be reused and developed further, it has been made available in a repository in a reusable format ("Markdown"). This repository also contains information on further contributions: <https://w3id.org/kim/kompendium>
